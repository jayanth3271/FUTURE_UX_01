# 🎨 Design Rationale – FitLife Studio

## 1️⃣ Design Goal
The goal was to create a visually appealing and conversion-focused fitness landing page that motivates users to explore programs and take action.

## 2️⃣ Color System
- Dark Blue: Represents strength, trust, and professionalism.
- Orange: Used for call-to-action buttons to attract attention.
- Light background: Improves readability and reduces visual strain.

## 3️⃣ Layout Strategy
A card-based layout was used to display fitness programs clearly. This improves content structure and helps users quickly compare options.

## 4️⃣ Visual Hierarchy
Typography sizes and spacing were carefully adjusted to guide user attention from the hero section to the program cards and call-to-action buttons.

## 5️⃣ User Experience
The interface is minimal, clean, and easy to navigate. Clear buttons and structured spacing reduce cognitive load and improve usability.
